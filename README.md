# E0-225_Design_and_Analysis_of_Algorithms
E0225: Design and Analysis of Algorithms is a foundational course at the Computer Science department, IISc Bengaluru. It aims to develop algorithmic thinking in students.

:accessibility: Highlights of important algorithmic paradigms and their real-world applications:
